The file Liczimpulsy.v contains a code which takes as input clock, reset, enable and direction and counts the amount of clock signal impulses. It was build as the begining to a potentiometer software.
The second file counts the amount of impulses generated manually by turning the potentiometer and determinates the direction base on the order of signals.
